**Friends, Romans, Netizens, lend us your ears!**

It is a time of turbulence in Rome as Caesar is celebrating his victory over rival Pompey. Many are thrilled but some remain more skeptical of Caesarâ€™s consolidation of power. How are the interests of Rome best served?

Director Meryl Federman leads Worlds Elsewhere theatre company in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Genderblind casting and "timeless" styling prompt us to take a fresh look at the responsibilities of those who hold power in a society.
