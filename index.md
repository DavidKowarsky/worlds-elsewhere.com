In support of Black Lives Matter, #8toAbolish, and community bail funds across the country, we will be running a charity benefit on June 20th, starting at 5:00 PM EST.

The evening shall have song, dance, and a full performance of William Shakespeare’s comic masterpiece *A Midsummer Night’s Dream*.

More details, including cast lists, to come!

*The play has always been the thing.*

**How to donate:** Worlds Elsewhere is supporting donations to the Community Bail Fund, a 70+ collection of bail funds, mutual aid funds, and racial justice organizations, curated by ActBlue.

### To support our donation drive:

1. Make a donation to the Community Bail Fund directly using [this link](http://communitybailfunds.com) during or before A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream.
2. Send proof of your donation (forwarded email receipt or a screen capture of the confirmation will suffice) to <worlds.elsewhere.theatre@gmail.com> — along with how you’d like to be credited on stream and in other thank you materials. We will use the name on your receipt unless you tell us a different one.
3. Keep watching! You’ll get a shout out on stream for sure and there will be a **Special Surprise** for our top three donors who contact us before the end of Act IV.

We will count donations that hit our inbox until midnight Eastern US time on June 21st, but your name can find its way into the show if you make it in before the curtain falls on Act IV, and if you’ve read this far, you probably think that’s cool!
