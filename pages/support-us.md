# Support Us

We want to bring actors, writers, directors, and other artists together to continue to our work in preserving and innovating the institution of theatre. We want to make social justice part of our mission as a theatre company. We want to keep learning and growing.

Thanks to the generosity of our [Founding Backers](./founding-backers), Worlds Elsewhere Theatre is able to support its operations as we launch into planning our 2021 productions! If you'd like to contribute, please sign up for our newsletter or follow us on social networking--there will be other ways to support us very soon, along with special perks!
