# Support Us

Worlds Elsewhere exists due to the dedication of creative professionals, and the support of those who believe in our mission and want to see us succeed. We will be ever grateful to those who joined us as [Founding Backers](./founding-backers), enabling us to lay our important financial and legal groundwork as we have operated through 2021. For those of you who want to support us financially, we are now able to accept donations through Paypal!

Please note: Our 501c3 status is currently pending so we cannot guarantee the tax deductibility of donations made at this time, but we can guarantee our profound appreciation for your generosity.

## Other Ways to Support Us

If you would prefer to support us in other ways, we need those too! We need people who are willing to tell their friends about us so there will be an audience, and we're always looking for more artists to work with us.
