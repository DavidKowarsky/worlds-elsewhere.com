# Support Us

Worlds Elsewhere exists due to the dedication of creative professionals, and the support of those who believe in our mission and want to see us succeed. We will be ever grateful to those who joined us as [Founding Backers](./founding-backers), enabling us to lay our important financial and legal groundwork as we have operated through 2021. For those of you who want to support us financially, we are now able to accept donations through Paypal!
