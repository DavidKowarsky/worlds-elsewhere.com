# About

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company was established to help preserve and innovate the institution of theatre by establishing a company of artists: performers, directors, writers, artisans, technical crew and others involved in the creative process who will continue to create through the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

We believe in the power of theatre to bring strength and comfort in times of distress, and to act as a force for social progress. We support the values of social justice, diversity, inclusion and charity. While our founders and majority of our repertory company are U.S based, our support for universal human rights and dignity knows no borders.

Our first production was a fundraising production, which peaked at over 350 simultaneous audience members during the stream, and has subsequently garnered over 7000 views on YouTube. We raised over $5000 for bail and mutual aid funds across the United States.

Worlds Elsewhere is committed to producing at least one show per year with a charitable focus.

Worlds Elsewhereâ€™s legal startup costs and the bulk of its second year operations were funded by the generosity of contributors to our [Founding Backers](./founding-backers).
