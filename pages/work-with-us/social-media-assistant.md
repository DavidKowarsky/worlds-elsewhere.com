# **Staff Call: Social Media Assistant**

**Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company** is seeking a **Social Media Assistant** to help grow our following by making sure our social media channels are active and engaged with the theatre and social justice communities. This is a great opportunity for someone interested in the intersection of theatre and charitable efforts to make a real difference, both in the lives of the artists our programming will support directly and the causes for which we fundraise.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company (501(c)(3) status pending) was established to help preserve and innovate the institution of theatre by establishing a company of artists: performers, directors, writers, artisans, technical crew, and others involved in the creative process who will continue to create through the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. [Our first production](/shows/2020.06/midsummer) was a fundraising production, which peaked at over 350 simultaneous audience members during the stream, and has subsequently garnered over 8000 views on YouTube. We raised over $5000 for bail and mutual aid funds across the United States.

## Duties

This position’s duties will include:

* Expand on and execute the calendar and plan of action developed by our Social Media Director (to whom you will report)
  * 3-5 posts weekly across our social channels (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and spend some time fielding/engaging with comments.
* Engage with content in the online theatre and social justice communities that further our brand voice and mission across the same channels
* Contribute to developing content suitable for paid promotion on Facebook

## Our Ideal Candidate

* Has strong written communication skills for social media, able to understand and interact with the public through social media while preserving brand voice
* Is conversant in the language and cultures of theatre and social justice
* Can post efficiently on Facebook Pages, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Familiarity with Hootsuite or similar social media management software is a plus
* Is reliable and responsive, generally around US East Coast time zone

If this is you, please send an email to [worlds.elsewhere.theatre@gmail.com](mailto:worlds.elsewhere.theatre@gmail.com) with the subject “Social Media Assistant” and with whatever information you think will help us make an informed, responsible decision.

<u>**Note**: Worlds Elsewhere has *no* paid staff at this time</u>; our funding priorities are stipends for our artists, expenses for our shows themselves, and the development of infrastructure through service and legal fees. This position will be a volunteer role for the first six months to a year, but as fundraising efforts ramp up, we hope to be able to offer a stipend.
