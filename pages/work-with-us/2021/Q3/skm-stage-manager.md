## Position Requirements

The **Stage Manager** will report to the Technical Director by making sure technical rehearsals and the show run smoothly. They will back up the assistant director with people-wrangling (especially on show days), and assist the Technical Director with creating and running cues and any other day-of-show technical requirements.

The stage manager will provide backup for the Assistant Director’s people-wrangling duties during tech week, and will make arrangements with the director and technical director for which non-tech rehearsals will require their presence.

Rehearsals will be a commitment of 2-3 weekday evenings (between 6-9PM Pacific) per week during the months of {%include ts.html ts="2021-09-01" fmt="September and October" %} until showtime and all tech week rehearsals (week of {%include ts.html ts="2021-10-18" fmt="October 18th" %}).

## Other Details

While this position is volunteer, we are currently pursuing our 501(c)(3) status. If we are legally able to do so, will issue you a tax-donation receipt based on your hours of service to the company. Also, this is a great opportunity if you’d be interested in technical direction for WETC in the future.
