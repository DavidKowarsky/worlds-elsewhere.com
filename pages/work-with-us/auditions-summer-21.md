# **Cast Call: 2021 Summer Cabaret Show Auditions**

**Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company** is now auditioning for its **2021 Summer Cabaret Show**! The show will be livestreamed, with Pay-What-You-Can tickets, with a suggested donation of $15, hosted on Youtube.com in early July. The show will include a mix of pre-recorded and live performances, with live MCs hosting the event.

We are looking for a total of 16-20 pieces, depending on length, for a total runtime of about 2 hours, as well as 2-4 MCs. We are especially looking for BIPOC performers, to bring diverse perspectives to both this show and future productions.

Auditions will be May 24th to June 10th, 7-10pm US ET. To audition, you must be ready to perform or explain the act you want to do for the cabaret (more details on that below).

## Theme: Summer and Renewal

We are looking for pieces that fit broadly into a theme of **summer** and/or **renewal**, since we are celebrating both the height of summer and the gradual return to a new normal as more people are being vaccinated. While those themes reflect the optimism that we hope to convey and nurture in this show, we do not intend to preclude honest expressions of upset and concern, for lo, there is still much work to be done.

We want a **PG-13 rating** for the event: language is fine, nudity is out, political content is fine but we want an overall positive tone (individual pieces can be less so); ask us if you have any questions.

## Requirements

Auditions are open to people outside the Repertory, as well as our Company and Associate members, with the following requirements:

1. We will be asking people to submit auditions with their final piece in mind.
2. All live acts are **required** to attend a mandatory rehearsal, the tech run, and the show itself.
3. All pre-recorded acts are **required** to submit their materials (with any editing notes) no later than June 23rd.

We additionally **encourage** live performers to attend at least one optional rehearsal during the office hours period, and pre-recorded performers are encouraged to attend the tech run and/or performance.

## About the Company

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company (501(c)(3) status pending) was established to help preserve and innovate the institution of theatre by establishing a company of artists: performers, directors, writers, artisans, technical crew, and others involved in the creative process who will continue to create through the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. [Our first production](/shows/2020.06/midsummer) was a fundraising production, which peaked at over 350 simultaneous audience members during the stream, and has subsequently garnered over 8000 views on YouTube. We raised over $5000 for bail and mutual aid funds across the United States.
