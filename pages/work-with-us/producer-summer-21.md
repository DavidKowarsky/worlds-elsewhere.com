</h2>

Directed by WETC's own **Ilana Greenberg-Sud,** to be livestreamed in conjunction with select cabaret acts and a talkback on **Jun 26th, 2021**. The performance will benefit [Trans Lifeline][trans-lifeline] and [Mermaids](https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/) -- two charities aimed at providing trans peer support and community care.

[trans-lifeline]: <https://translifeline.org> "Trans Lifeline is a grassroots hotline and microgrants 501(c)(3) non-profit organization offering direct emotional and financial support to trans people in crisis â€“ for the trans community, by the trans community."
[mermaids]: <https://mermaids.org.uk>

Auditions will be announced April 19th and will take place **the week of April 26th.**

In addition to auditions, this brings us to a wonderful crew opportunity for participation in WETC's charitable mission!

Currently, we are looking for a **Producer**.

The **Producer** will assist the director in setting the rehearsal schedule, and own most of the email and Discord communication with the cast and crew, including rehearsal reminders + links. They will make arrangements for any purchases for the show (working with our company's Business Manager), lead the charge on finding and licensing music/sound fx (delivering to our Technical Director), and ensure all copy for the program makes it to the web team in time.

Rehearsals will be a commitment of 2-3 weekday evenings (between 7-10PM Eastern) per week during the months of May and June until showtime and all tech week rehearsals (week of June 21st). The Assistant director will ideally join for 3-4 nights of auditions in the week of April 26th. The AD is expected to attend 70% of rehearsals minimum. The producer should be ready to act as backup for the Assistant Director's scribe and people-wrangling duties, and be available to handle issues during tech week.

While this position is volunteer, we are currently pursuing our 501(c)(3) status. If we are legally able to do so, will issue you a tax-donation receipt based on your hours of service to the company.

If you are interested in the Producer position, please email us at <worlds.elsewhere.theatre@gmail.com> with the subject "Producer App". Include any relevant experience and why you're interested in helping out by April 20th.
