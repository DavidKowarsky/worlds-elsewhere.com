# **Staff Call: 2021 Summer Cabaret Banner Artist**

**Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company** is looking to make a **paid commission** for Banner Art assets for our Summer 2021 Summer Cabaret show.

## Theme: Summer and Renewal

The show will fit broadly into a theme of **summer** and/or **renewal**, since we are celebrating both the height of summer and the gradual return to a new normal as more people are being vaccinated. While those themes reflect the optimism that we hope to convey and nurture in this show, we do not intend to preclude honest expressions of upset and concern, for lo, there is still much work to be done.

## Requirements

The banner we are looking for will be used on our website, YouTube, in our Newsletter, and on our Social Media accounts. We will adapt the design to convey different information, including the final performance stream date and time, promotional information about individual acts and performers, etc, and may borrow elements for other branding asset generation as needed.

The resulting artwork should meet the following *technical* limitations:

1. 16:9 aspect ratio; this is the ratio of our video and streaming content on Youtube.
2. Designed to be legible at most common stream resolutions (240p to 2160p).
3. All text areas should be constrained to within a 4:3 aspect ratio box centered within the banner.
4. Source files should be provided with text within editable layers.

For our usage, we will also require the following licensing constraints:

1. The final banner design rights and files will either belong solely to Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company, or be licensed such that rights to usage, distribution, modification, and adaptation are permitted to the Company on a permanent basis.
2. All incorporated fonts and other assets used in the design must likewise be properly licensed for our use and reuse, including for commercial purposes.
3. We will provide attribution to the Banner Artist in our show's program, and can and will attribute other sources as necessary.

The company may negotiate reasonable limitations to modifications and adaptations on the work; the commissioned Artist will work directly with the production staff.

### Design Delivery Deadlines

As we require the final assets for outreach in mid-June, we will require an initial draft by {%include ts.html ts="2021-06-07" fmt="Monday, June 7th" %}, with up to two revisions before a final copy on {%include ts.html ts="2021-06-14" fmt="Monday, June 14th."%}.

## Other Details

Payment for this commission is negotiable and will be based on your rates and our budgetary requirements.

We look forward to potentially building an ongoing relationship with interested artists. If you are amenable, we may reach out for future commissions.

## About the Company

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company (501(c)(3) status pending) was established to help preserve and innovate the institution of theatre by establishing a company of artists: performers, directors, writers, artisans, technical crew, and others involved in the creative process who will continue to create through the difficult times of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. [Our first production](/shows/2020.06/midsummer) was a fundraising production, which peaked at over 350 simultaneous audience members during the stream, and has subsequently garnered over 8000 views on YouTube. We raised over $5000 for bail and mutual aid funds across the United States.
