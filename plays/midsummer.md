[![A Midsummer Night's Charity Stream Banner](/assets/img/plays/midsummer/banner.jpg)][yt-stream]

On Jun 20th, 2020, In support of Black Lives Matter, #8toAbolish, and community bail funds across the country, the Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company hosted a charity drive as its first production &mdash; a full live-streamed performance of William Shakespeare's comic masterpiece *A Midsummer Night's Dream*.

Worlds Elsewhere supported donations to the [Community Bail Fund](http://communitybailfunds.com), a 70+ collection of bail funds, mutual aid funds, and racial justice organizations, curated by [ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/).

Donors who made donations before the curtain fell on A Midsummer Night's Charity Stream's Act IV were thanked on stream, and the top three donors got a special surprise during Act V.

## Company Artistic Statement

Theatre, given its nature as a medium made of people in space, has always been a first victim during times of plague.

When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the world at the start of the year 2020, theatres closed, and millions were left unemployed.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company was founded during this terrifying time. It is our mission to create theatre without a theatre - to create a space online that can serve as a theatrical one. Our company shall create an online space that serves the same function that theatre has served for millennia &mdash; as a place of catharsis and healing.

## About This Production

A Midsummer Night’s Dream takes place over the course of four days (or possibly five, scholars debate) leading up to the prestigious wedding of the Duke of Athens to his Amazon Queen. A ragtag band of performers is charged with preparing wedding entertainment, while four young lovers struggle to seek happiness when their feelings run counter to the arrangements of their parents. As the wedding draws closer, the performers and lovers find themselves pawns in a game between the fairy king and queen. A fairy’s charms could render even the mightiest of intellects useless in their path...  given that, the fools that these mortals be don’t stand a chance.

---

This staging-minus-a-stage of A Midsummer Night’s Dream began as a very different production. The inaugural production for Worlds Elsewhere Theatre was originally going to be the avant garde classic French precursor to surrealism, dadaism, and a hundred other movements, Alfred Jarry’s King Ubu. There was a first table read and a handful of rehearsals, but changing times called for a defter play.

So, we kept our inertia going and decided to turn our efforts towards something simpler, more accessible, and fun. Naturally, we went to Shakespeare.

Times change, as they always do, and even in tough times we can mark the calendar. The midsummer solstice is a time of renewal, and to mark the holiday we chose Shakespeare’s comedy of changing times.

It’s easy to forget that the Dream takes place at the end of a war - the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta marks the peace after the Athenian conquest of the Amazons. “Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword, and won thy love, doing thee injuries;” Theseus confesses in the opening scene. He leaves an entire bloody campaign implied, but quickly brushed aside. “But I will wed thee in another key” he promises, inviting hope that their nuptials will lead to a new order, and a new peace.

Shakespeare’s comedy sends its characters, nobles and commoners who could easily end up dead in a tragedy, are sent out of their existing social order and into a fairyland. That is, a land where love rules all, identity is fluid, norms are broken, and anything is possible. It’s a dream that is both respite and roadmap, inspiring them to see their world in a new way.

It is in this spirit that we hope to dream of a better world. We invite you to join us for this dream, and in a world changed for the better on the other side.

-- Kyle Kallgren & David Kowarsky

## About the Issues

There are many issues one might have with the justice system in our country, but among the most urgent is bail reform. The profound inequity in how the bail system treats defendants with and without money, and the consequential ability of the police to confine people who have not been given trial is, as Snout would say, “a parlous fear.” This only grows more true in the world where mass arrests grow common, and politicians seek to justify suspending the right to a speedy trial.

We believe that the problems that plague our society cannot be solved by growing threats of force, but only by growing presence of empathy.

We believe our political institutions must fundamentally and consequentially reimagine their understanding of “the police” -- before those forces can live into their declared functions to serve and protect the people.

We believe that those who have the strength to protest deserve our support and not to be deprived of freedom as they place their bodies on the line to preserve it for us all.

It is in service of these beliefs that we chose the community bail fund by organized by Actblue as the target of our philanthropic endeavor. We must give strength and support to those who take the responsibility of direct action personally upon their shoulders and incur wrath the consequences of a system that is already profoundly biased against people who aren’t wealthy.

In addition, bail fund donations are, in nearly all cases, very likely to be used multiple times as most defendants do show up, and the funds are thus recovered in their entirety.

## Cast and Crew

**Arielle Dundas** (Master of Ceremonies, understudy: Snout; she/her) is a stunningly talented standup comedian, at least that's what she's written in this bio. She is based in  New York City and/or Amsterdam, it's a little unclear at the moment. She has performed all over the world, including two hours at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Philosophical, but personal. Silly, but cerebral. Provocative, but primarily hilarious.

**Boostocking** (Cobweb; she/her) is a podcaster, writer, and wistful ghost staring out of a stained glass window. Keeping things eerie but positive is her goal. She is one of the main creators and developers of the (hopefully soon to premiere) Fearly Beloved, an inclusive, diverse, and LGBT+ filled comedy podcast about how to be kind and welcoming to a world of magical beings who have finally come out of the crypt after years in the shadows.

He pursues commercial and character voiceover and is a passionate patron of the New York Neo Futurists, with whom he’s studied their unique brand of experimental theater.
