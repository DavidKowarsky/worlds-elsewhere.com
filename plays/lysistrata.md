Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company Presents: Lysistrata by Aristophanes, Translated by George Theodoridis, Directed By Ilana Greenberg-Sud.

The Greek city-states are at war, but Lysistrata, a woman of Athens, thinks the war is wasteful and stupid, and wants it to end. But her wants are no mere idle musing! She has a plan to make the men in power listen, but she can’t do it alone.

In a socially distant, modern-dress presentation of Aristophanes’ classic comedy, translated to the vernacular by George Theodoridis and edited by Ilana Greenberg-Sud, we’ll learn just how much has and has not changed since the days of Ancient Greece.

## Company Artistic Statement

Theatre, given its nature as a medium made of people in space, has always been a first victim during times of plague.

When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the world at the start of the year 2020, theatres closed, and millions were left unemployed.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company was founded during this terrifying time. It is our mission to create theatre without _a_ theatre - to create a space online that can serve as a theatrical one. Our company shall create an online space that serves the same function that theatre has served for millennia -- as a place of catharsis and healing.

## About This Production

> I picked Lysistrata, in part, because it's a revered Classical comedy that centers the actions of women. More generally, it's a story of people who aren't on the front lines of a conflict taking steps on their own to end it. As someone with a long-lived love of charitable and activist theatre, this means a lot to me. Even though the primary adversity we're facing in the United States (and in many other parts of the world) at the moment is not an open armed conflict, I believe that the important messages about listening to women and the power of peace are relevant and resonant in our present crises.
>
> As we worked our way through the script, I found myself occasionally wincing, as the text did not always live up to my high school memory of how feminist or progressive it was. And yet...what still rang true for today continued to speak so much more loudly than that which seemed antiquated. I chose this modern language translation to capitalize on those elements, and made additional small changes to encourage the audience to see themselves and the problems of the modern world in the show. What I hope to accomplish with this production and the choices that I've made as director (besides uproarious laughter) is to remind our audience that everyone has the power to bring about a more peaceful world -- especially women.
>
> The ancient Greek world, as portrayed by Lysistrata, has a very binary concept of gender. It is the goal of this production to present this play while still honoring a modern, complex view of gender, so casting decisions were made with the intention of presenting the conflict of the play while still respecting the gender diversity of our cast and audience. We cast the show with a weighting towards the stated preference of our auditioning performers, doing our best to avoid excessive reliance on traditional gender performance.

## The Plot

The Greek city-states are at war, but LYSISTRATA, a woman of Athens, thinks the war is wasteful and stupid, and wants it to end. She collects a group of women representing all of Greece (her neighbor, CALONIKI; MYRRHINI, a young Athenian wife and mother; LAMPITO from Sparta; ISMENIA from Boeotia; and THE CORINTHIAN) and suggests a solution: a sex strike. The women of Greece will refuse to have sex with their husbands and lovers until the men end the war. Despite being hesitant, the women agree and swear an oath to refuse all sexual contact until peace is achieved.

To support their cause, the OLD WOMEN OF ATHENS have taken over the Acropolis, keeping the men from accessing the treasury that pays for their war. The OLD MEN OF ATHENS (DRAKIS, PHILOURGOS, PHADRIAS, STRYNIDOROS) attempt to burn down the Acropolis to drive the women out, but are rebuffed by the women, led by STRATYLLIS and including NIKOTHIKI, KALLYKI, RHODIPPI, and KRYTILLI. The MAGISTRATE, accompanied by SKYTHIAN ARCHERS (police) arrives to see why the women are rebelling and convince them to stop, and is humiliated by Lysistrata and her followers before being chased off.

The old men and old women clash again, insulting each other but not accomplishing much.

Lysistrata reappears, bemoaning the fact that many of the women are so desperate for sex they are willing to abandon the cause under the flimsiest of excuses. She begs, persuades, and hounds them into staying, and they eventually agree.

[intermission]

CINESIAS, husband of Myrrhini, arrives with their CHILD and servant MANES to try to persuade her to come home and take care of her “responsibilities'' as a wife and mother. Lysistrata encourages Myrrhini to tease but ultimately deny her husband, and she does, riling him up and then leaving without alleviating his...condition.

Drakis and his men commiserate over their shared problem with Cinesias. A SPARTAN HERALD arrives, afflicted with the same malady, and begs to meet with the Athenian council to discuss peace.

The men and women face off once more.

Two SPARTAN DELEGATES arrive, ready to talk peace. POLYCHARIDES and another ATHENIAN DELEGATE arrive as well, and the men commiserate before calling for Lysistrata to state her terms and help them negotiate. Lysistrata distracts them with a nude LADY PEACE (The Corinthian, holding a map of Greece). The delegates agree to peace talks and leave the stage.

The delegates celebrate the successful peace talks by getting roaring drunk, chasing off VAGRANTS who have gathered at the gates. Lysistrata and the others celebrate accomplishing their goal, and the imminent return of conjugal relations. The Athenian and Spartan delegates thank the gods for their success, and the play ends.

- **River Lane** (Philourgos; she/her/they/them) is a third year Cinema and Media Studies student (which is just an English degree where she studies _movies_ by white men instead of _books_ by white men). This is her first production with both Worlds Elsewhere and professional theatre work, and she’s excited that she got invited. You can find her on Twitter [<span class="social twitter"></span>@DreamsRebel](https://twitter.com/dreamsrebel) or on tumblr at [<span class="social tumblr"></span>film-lion.tumblr.com](http://film-lion.tumblr.com/).

He'd like to thank all of his collaborators on this project, and to remind you that antifascism starts at home.
- When he is not playing despicable old men like Egeus in _A Midsummer's Night's Charity Stream_, **Henry Joseph Kathman** (Strynidoros; he/him) is an English Teacher and Video Essayist who writes about Animation, Literature, Film, and Philosophy.

_<ins>PRODUCTION</ins>_

- **Ilana Greenberg-Sud** (Director/Script Editor; she/her/they/them) has been involved in theatre for 20 years, from backstage to on-stage to front-of-house to management. She especially loves charitable and activist theatre; she has produced and/or directed _The Vagina Monologues_ three times, stage managed _The Crucible_, co-founding Worlds Elsewhere, and producing WETC’s _A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream_, among other projects. She is honored to work with such a talented group of performers, and is excited to share her vision for this weird, wonderful old play. Ilana is currently on social media hiatus, but can be found on Twitter at [<span class="social twitter"></span>@melaynebakes](https://twitter.com/melaynebakes), where she can be seen yelling about politics, queer and Jewish issues, and representation in media, as well as being a Giant Nerd.
- **Kyle Kallgren** (Assistant Director/Dramaturg; he/him) is the co-founder of the Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company, as well as host of the web series [<span class="social youtube"></span>Brows Held High](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0KaZd_ki4l2EUc1GY9u5Ew). He can occasionally be seen on his YouTube channel.
- **Meryl Federman** (Producer/Stage Manager/Assistant Director; she/her) was last seen in Worlds Elsewhere's production of _A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream_ as Lysander, but has returned to her natural habitat backstage as Producer, Stage Manager, and Assistant Director for _Lysistrata_, where she mightily enjoys giggling along at the cast's delightful hilarity and is glad her mic is usually off. She keeps threatening to make a long video essay about Shakespeare but has not yet done so, and once directed an ancient Greek play herself back in college, though it was _Oedipus_ and thus not quite as funny. Vote!
- **Dodger Of Zion**’s (Technical Director; she/her) last technical work was for Worlds Elsewhere’s production of _A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream_, where, in the course of her duties during the show, she was responsible for the spawning of the “Hail the Cone” meme. She streams on [<span class="social twitch"></span>Twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/dodgerofzion), and is the Philadelphia sports contributor to the weekly YouTube sports podcast _The Dumpster Fire_. When she’s not streaming or pushing buttons to bring virtual theatre to the world, she can be found playing _Animal Crossing_, yelling at football, and planting potatoes.
- High school Physics and Math Teacher by day, **Jacob Brode** (Assistant Combat Trainer/Choreographer; he/him) is thrilled that his decades of obsessively watching Power Rangers has allowed him to assist with the Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company's action choreography! Apart from his experience making people on the internet fighting each other look like much _larger_ groups of people on the internet fighting each other, he’s spent over a decade in college and community theatre, with plenty of directing, writing, scenic design, and other production roles under his belt. You can see more of Jake on the [<span class="social youtube"></span>Database Ranger's Power Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/user/databaseranger) YouTube channel, where he engages in adventure-filled Power Rangers meta-analyses alongside his wonderful wife, MJ.
