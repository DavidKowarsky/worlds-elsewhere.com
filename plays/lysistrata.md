# Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company Presents: <br>[**Lysistrata**][yt-stream]

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company Presents: Lysistrata by Aristophanes, Translated by George Theodoridis, Directed By Ilana Greenberg-Sud.

The Greek city-states are at war, but Lysistrata, a woman of Athens, thinks the war is wasteful and stupid, and wants it to end. But her wants are no mere idle musing! She has a plan to make the men in power listen, but she can't do it alone.

In a socially distant, modern-dress presentation of Aristophanes' classic comedy, translated to the vernacular by George Theodoridis, we'll learn just how much has and has not changed since the days of Ancient Greece.

## Company Artistic Statement

Theater, given its nature as a medium made of people in space, has always been a first victim during times of plague.

When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the world at the start of the year 2020, theaters closed, and millions were left unemployed.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre was founded during this terrifying time. It is our mission to create a theatre without theatre - to create a space online that can serve as a theatrical one. Our company shall create an online space that serves the same function that theatre has served for millennia- as a place of catharsis and healing.
