## Company Artistic Statement

Theatre, given its nature as a medium made of people in space, has always been a first victim during times of plague.

When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the world at the start of the year 2020, theatres closed, and millions were left unemployed.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company was founded during this terrifying time. It is our mission to create theatre without a theatre - to create a space online that can serve as a theatrical one. Our company shall create an online space that serves the same function that theatre has served for millennia – as a place of catharsis and healing.

## About This Production

After more than fifteen months of uncertainty and fear, much of the world has begun to reopen from the lockdown measures of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As we enter into this new normal, we choose to embrace optimism, renewal, and the potential for further growth.  In the same spirit that drove us towards our first summer production, we look to redirect our long-suffering psyches towards celebrations for the better world that we know is possible.

Join us as over 20 performers, both newcomers and veterans alike, present an array of songs, skits, and monologues on the themes of this better world and the great work that still remains ahead of us.

### Production

**Ilana Greenberg** (Director, Stage Manager; she/her/they/them) is a writer, cosplayer, director, producer, performer, and whatever else needs doing when it comes to making theatre. In addition to helping found Worlds Elsewhere, she made her directorial re-debut in October ‘20 with _Lysistrata_, and produced _A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream_ and the 2020 Winter Cabaret. She is forever grateful and inspired to work with such a talented group of performers, and is excited to expand the Worlds Elsewhere community with every show. She doesn’t intentionally have a small social media footprint, but her continued hiatus from Twitter has been very restful.

**Sam Marchiony** (Assistant Director, “A New Horizon”; she/they) is an overly educated performing artist who occasionally makes videos on the Internet to talk about femmes and feminism in pop culture and why kyriarchy must be smashed. You can find these videos at [<i yt>La Femme Fictionale</i>](<https://youtube.com/channel/UCFfVeXeCO-5lNuH9Gnad2Cw> "La Femme Fictionale on youtube.com") on YouTube, or follow [<i twitter>@FemmeFictionale</i>](<https://twitter.com/FemmeFictionale> "@FemmeFictionale on twitter.com") on the Bird App. She has also, at different points in time, been a playwright, director, costumer, producer, and actor, most recently in the Worlds Elsewhere productions of _Julius Caesar_ (Lucilius/Servants), _Lysistrata_ (Ismenia), and _A Midsummer Night's Charity Stream_ (Philostrate). To Kyle, Ilana, Dave, and the entire company and crew of WE…you are soup, and I love you.

**Kyle Kallgren** (Producer, Video Editing; he/him) is an online video creator (he dislikes the term ‘YouTuber’) who has been creating content for over eleven years. A performer and editor, he directed Worlds Elsewhere’s inaugural charity production of _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_ and the 2020 Winter Cabaret, as well as coming up with the name “Worlds Elsewhere”, taken from a line in _Coriolanus_. You can find his work on the YouTube channel [<i yt>KyleKallgrenBHH</i>](<https://youtube.com/channel/UC0KaZd_ki4l2EUc1GY9u5Ew> "KyleKallgrenBHH on youtube.com"), where he has over 75k subscribers. He is the proud owner of zero birds.

**Justin Bailey** (Assistant Producer; he/him) made his Worlds Elsewhere debut in _Julius Caesar_ (Soothsayer); he has never been afraid to try something new just because he’s never done it before. That’s what makes it new, right? The majority of his previous acting has been volunteer or hobby-based, the most prominent of which being a crew member of Haunted Overload in New Hampshire, which he has done off and on for over a decade. Special thanks to Marjorie Mersereau, for helping give him the acting bug in the first place.

**Adrianne Greenberg-Sud** (Technical Director, Graphic & Web Design; she/her) is a senior full stack software developer in Seattle, WA. She has been supporting Worlds Elsewhere's technological needs since the company's founding in 2020. She's very proud to offer her skills toward Worlds Elsewhere's mission &mdash; live theatre, for everyone, everywhere. She can be found via her website, [<i ext>pigsflew.com</i>](<https://pigsflew.com> "External Link to Site: pigsflew.com") and on social media as "pigsflew" on [<i twitter>Twitter</i>](<https://twitter.com/pigsflew> "@pigsflew on twitter.com"), [<i linkedin>LinkedIn</i>](<https://linkedin.com/in/pigsflew> "pigsflew on linkedin.com"), and [<i github>Github</i>](<https://github.com/pigsflew> "pigsflew on github.com").

**Laura Crone** (Video Editing; she/her) is a writer, producer, host, and editor of online video based out of Los Angeles. Fans of Worlds Elsewhere may recognize her work as an editor ("Seize the Day," Donor Gala), arranger ("Are You Doing New Year's Eve," Winter Cabaret) and performer (Portia, Julius Caesar; Myrrhini, Lysistrata; Hermia, A Midsummer Night's Dream).
