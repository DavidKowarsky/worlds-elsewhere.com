## Company Artistic Statement

Theatre, given its nature as a medium made of people in space, has always been a first victim during times of plague.

When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the world at the start of the year 2020, theatres closed, and millions were left unemployed.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company was founded during this terrifying time. It is our mission to create theatre without *a* theatre - to create a space online that can serve as a theatrical one. Our company shall create an online space that serves the same function that theatre has served for millennia -- as a place of catharsis and healing.

## About This Production

At the end of a particularly terrible year, Worlds Elsewhere’s first cabaret is meant to be many things. First, it is a celebration. During the harsh winter months it is traditional in many cultures to celebrate community, as a way both to weather the harsh months to come and to celebrate the accomplishments of the past year. Our performers, all veterans of past WE productions, are here to celebrate the talent they’ve nurtured and the community they’ve built in a new, socially distant world.

Second, it is a call to action. Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company’s first year has been primarily charity-driven, but in the coming year we want to be able to support artists. So, we are asking for the support of you, the audience. This may involve licensing newer works not in the public domain, spending on tech, costumes, and props for our performers, or compensating our performers and administrative staff for productions that are not directly associated with a charitable event. As a new organization, we'll need to retain the services of lawyers to help us get set up as an LLC, then to establish and maintain our status as a 501(c)(3) organization so we can directly handle funds for our charitable efforts, rather than simply directing people to an outside site to donate. All this can be realized with our <i igg>Indiegogo campaign</i> which ends Dec 21, 11:59pm ET.

And third, this cabaret is a wail of exhaustion. So we have a lineup of songs and stories for the end of an insane year. Bring on some catharsis, cause…DAMN.

Tonight she has the pleasure of being part of a number of different performances in their Winter Cabaret. In spite of how terrible this year has been, she has been looking forward to the holiday season in hopes of spreading some cheer, and hopes tonight’s show will be part of that. Much love and thanks to her friends and family. May someone hold you safe and warm, let’s continue to make it through this year, and if all else fails, let it snow.

**RJ Mayo** (“The Singing Sister”; they/them) is an actor in Toronto, Ontario, where they are in their second year of a three-year theatre program.

You can find incredibly intermittent content on their Youtube channel, [<i yt>RJ Mayo</i>](https://youtube.com/channel/UCwck9mr-IgwMNNe7ScoYpSg).

**Jamie McConnaughy** (“When Peace Broke Out”, “New Year’s Resolution”; she/her) is a 30-year-old Alaskan-born cinephile, and this middle part of the bio was originally something self-deprecating, but she's been trying to resolve to be nicer to herself this coming year, so she's just going to say that she's incredibly honored to be consistently included with the Worlds Elsewhere Theatre. Her twitter can be found at [<i twitter>@elessar42</i>](http://twitter.com/elessar42) and her tumblr at [<i tumblr>football-in-tuxedos.tumblr.com</i>](http://football-in-tuxedos.tumblr.com/), where she announces and discusses most of her other projects and also talks about *The Lord of the Rings* way too much.

**Hannah Moran** (“River”; she/her) is so excited to be part of this special Worlds Elsewhere production! Previous Worlds Elsewhere credits include *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* (Unnamed Fairy) and *Lysistrata* (The Corinthian/Lady Peace). Hannah started studying for her Master’s this fall, but she also produces song covers of questionable quality on her [<i yt>YouTube channel</i>](https://youtube.com/channel/UC9a0uXxuHj51n6iuhbnJ1FA). She can also be found on Twitter [<i twitter>@HannahBea_Moran</i>](https://twitter.com/HannahBea_Moran).

**Maciek Nowak/Wensleydale Cheddar** (“When Peace Broke Out”, “Let It Snow”; they/them) is a stammering mess of a manga podcaster and video essayist from Poland. English phonetician and animator by trade, they discuss short series in Manga Mosaic and read through World Trigger volume by volume in Duckface Diaries, mostly talking about structure, character dynamics and political readings. Look out for their animated fantasy series, Pengantar, coming out in 2021? Hopefully? Probably? Eh, don't count on it.

They are both very excited to be a part of the Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company Winter Cabaret! You can follow their antics on Instagram at [<i gram>@refractoryperiodtheband</i>](https://instagr.am/refractoryperiodtheband/).

**Daniel Russell** (“The ‘War on Christmas’”; he/him) is thrilled to once again work with Worlds Elsewhere. You might have seen him as the dude with the lion head in the company’s previous production of *A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream* and a grumpy old man in *Lysistrata*. He’d like to thank all of his collaborators on this project, and to remind you that antifascism starts at home.

**Grady W Smithey III** (“When Peace Broke Out”; he/him) has played the Magistrate in *Lysistrata* and Snout in *A Midsummer Night's Charity Stream* for Worlds Elsewhere, Arnold in *Sinatra* for A Light In Dark Places, Kokol in *Marat/Sade* for L.I.P.

**Morgan Stutler** (“This Year”; he/him) — An aspiring voice actor and printer technician originally from Michigan, Morgan moved to Richmond, Virginia in early 2018 and has been a happy presence with Worlds Elsewhere through several productions as he works towards a proper presence online.

### Production

**<u>Director/Video Editor:</u> Kyle Kallgren** (“This Year”; he/him), co-founder of Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company, was born during a transporter accident where a copy of Stan Lee's *How to Draw Comics The Marvel Way!* was fused with a copy of Umberto Eco's *Six Walks in the Fictional Woods*, and the result looked into the mirror and said, "Meh." He has been making Video Internet Content professionally for ten years and his work can be found littered across the internet, in particular on [<i yt>youtube/KyleKallgrenBHH</i>](https://youtube.com/channel/UC0KaZd_ki4l2EUc1GY9u5Ew). He directed the WE company's inaugural charity production of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, where he also played Theseus. He's incredibly excited about the future of WE and for the next year of online theatre!

**<u>Assistant Director:</u> Bex Silberfein** (“Light One Candle”; she/her) is thrilled to be back in a Worlds Elsewhere production! She'd like to thank Kyle for letting her assistant direct, and Ilana for introducing her to the incredible “Light One Candle” by Peter, Paul, and Mary. She can be found at [<i gram>Bex_Silberfein</i>](https://instagr.am/Bex_Silberfein) on insta and [<i twitter>@MeddlingMeddy</i>](https://twitter.com/meddlingmeddy) on twitter. Happy Holidays!

**<u>Producer/Stage Manager:</u> Ilana Greenberg-Sud** (“The Long Road to Shehecheyanu”; she/her/they/them) usually prefers to hibernate between Halloween and Passover, but, as they say, the show must go on. In addition to helping found Worlds Elsewhere, she made her directorial re-debut in October with *Lysistrata*, and produced *A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream*. She is honored to work with such a wonderful group of performers, and is excited to see what will come next.

**<u>Technical Director:</u> Dodger of Zion**’s (she/her) last technical work was for Worlds Elsewhere’s production of Lysistrata. She is also responsible for the spawning of the “Hail the Cone” meme. She streams on [<i twitch>Twitch.tv</i>](https://twitch.tv/dodgerofzion), and is the Philadelphia sports contributor to the weekly YouTube sports podcast The Dumpster Fire. When she’s not streaming or pushing buttons to bring virtual theatre to the world, she can be found playing Animal Crossing, yelling at football, and planting potatoes.

**<u>Writer:</u> Jack Nee** (“When Peace Broke Out”; [<i ext>no pronouns</i>][pflag-no-pronouns]) was seen in *Lysistrata* with Worlds Elsewhere and is a theatre practitioner currently focusing on documentary theatre while advocating for safe and equitable representation for performers and playwrights, starting at home. The work continues.
