promo: "Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company has always made an effort to explore all the opportunities granted to us by the virtual theatre medium, and in that spirit, we invite you to our next exciting experiment: **a workshop of a new short play, _The Space Between_, written by Company Member Meredith Cook and directed by co-founder Kyle Kallgren**. This is a brand new type of project for us -- a proof-of-concept, if you will -- and a test for future members-only content for our upcoming Patreon.\n\n
        Repertory members (i.e Company and Associate) as well as our Indiegogo supporters will be invited to join us for a private stream of a staged reading of the play, with the chance to provide comments to the playwright; in turn, Meredith will use these comments to improve on her script, then a staged reading of the new script will be performed live on YouTube."

_Excited? Here's the details:_

The **private staged reading** of the workshop script will be in a Zoom room on **Saturday, August 28th, beginning at 7pm US ET**. We'll do a little introduction to how everything works, then the cast will perform the play. We'll take a quick intermission, then we'll come back for a talkback with the director, cast, and playwright, where the audience can provide feedback (there will also be a form to provide feedback that will be anonymized before being handed over). Then, through the magic of editing and rehearsal, **a polished version of the show will be performed live on YouTube on Saturday, September 25th, 7pm US ET**, along with a live interview talkback and a separate behind-the-scenes video about the workshop process.

_A little bit about the play:_

A century into the future, Kore, a college student, is on an intergalactic journey to find her brother. At space station after space station, she meets the same mysterious stranger, whose business plans lead them on a journey that seems to be intertwined with Kore's. Through a series of vignettes, they uncover more about each other's secrets, and what stays constant as the galaxy changes around them.
