promo: "Directed by **Mike Fatum**, Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company is proud to announce our Fall 2021 Charity Stream, benefitting [<i ext>Trans Lifeline</i>][she-kills-monsters_TransLifeline] and [<i ext>Mermaids UK</i>][she-kills-monsters_MermaidsUK] -- two charities aimed at providing trans peer support and community care.\n\n
    **She Kills Monsters** is a comedic romp into the world of fantasy role-playing games. In this high-octane dramatic comedy laden with homicidal fairies, nasty ogres, and 90s pop culture, acclaimed playwright **Qui Nguyen** (\"Raya and the Last Dragon\") offers a heart-pounding homage to the geek and warrior within us all.\n\n"
