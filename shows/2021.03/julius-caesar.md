**Friends, Romans, Netizens, lend us your ears!**

It is a time of turbulence in Rome as Caesar is celebrating his victory over rival Pompey. Many are thrilled but some remain more skeptical of Caesar’s consolidation of power. How are the interests of Rome best served?

Director Meryl Federman leads Worlds Elsewhere theatre company in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Genderblind casting and "timeless" styling prompt us to take a fresh look at the responsibilities of those who hold power in a society.

## Company Artistic Statement

Theatre, given its nature as a medium made of people in space, has always been a first victim during times of plague.

When the COVID-19 pandemic spread through the world at the start of the year 2020, theatres closed, and millions were left unemployed.

Worlds Elsewhere Theatre Company was founded during this terrifying time. It is our mission to create theatre without a theatre — to create a space online that can serve as a theatrical one. Our company shall create an online space that serves the same function that theatre has served for millennia — as a place of catharsis and healing.

## Support Us

Worlds Elsewhere is pleased to present Julius Caesar on a pay-what-you-want basis. The first ticket option allows you to pay a minimum of $1.00 USD (+ processing fees).

If you would like to attend the talkback for our show featuring the director, producer, and a selection of cast members, choose the “+ Talkback” option and pay the minimum of $15.00 USD (+ processing fees). We will contact ticket holders who have chosen this option during intermission with the Zoom link to join the talkback after the show.

## About This Production

> There may be no Shakespeare play with more historical baggage than *Julius Caesar*. Since Abraham Lincoln’s administration, Americans have been processing their political landscape through its lens, the original assassination and Dante’s classic condemnation of it rendered through Shakespeare’s text. Shakespeare succeeds at making grand political gestures personal and visceral, but he withholds a judgment of Julius Caesar directly. Is Caesar’s ascendance a threat to Rome, or a great opportunity? And whose job should it be to address this either way? As our main characters navigate these questions, we see Brutus, Cassius, Antony, and Caesar display classical-tragic symptoms, and three suffer their final tragic fate in the play itself. No matter what “side” you’re on, misreading your moment and misapplying your skills is deadly. For this reason, *Caesar* feels most relevant not as a way to understand an inter-party fight, but an intra-party one. Quite simply, *Julius Caesar* feels like a high-stakes primary - where we may all roughly be on the same team, but we can disagree on tactics, ethics, a theory of change, and who should represent us. The potential for a truly great outcome can heighten a perceived loss. In a political landscape filled with allies (or potential allies), family, friends, and those we generally respect, setbacks and disagreements can feel magnified and extremely personal. This is not a play of righteous heroes and condemnable villains, not a play of one noble group and one immoral one, but of people asking “given my position, and the *interesting* times I’m living in, what must I do?” Our characters break themselves trying to answer this question, and through the ages this challenge has resonated with readers and audiences.
>
> I humbly hope that this production strips away some of the baggage of this towering text, and that you see something new in our story of individuals struggling to understand their responsibilities in a political order that is still being formed.

~ Meryl Federman, Director

### The Plot

#### ACT I

It is a time of turbulence in Rome as Caesar is celebrating his victory over rival Pompey. The people are thrilled, but tribunes Flavius and Marullus, as members of the political establishment, are more skeptical of Caesar’s consolidation of power. At the celebration, Caesar declines to heed a Soothsayer’s warning about the swiftly approaching Ides of March. Senator Caius Cassius, livid over Caesar’s ascendance, approaches close friend and fellow Senator Marcus Brutus, to see if he shares this anxiety - Brutus does, and Cassius all but asks Brutus to join an assassination plot. The night before the Ides of March, a supernaturally-charged storm batters Rome as the conspirators gather at Brutus’ house to plan their attack. They decide to kill Caesar in the Senate, but decline to pursue Caesar’s allies, including Mark Antony. After the group leaves, Brutus’ wife Portia demands to know what Brutus is doing, but he is interrupted by the arrival of another conspirator before he can tell her. The next morning, Caesar’s wife Calpurnia almost convinces her husband to not leave the house based on all the supernatural portents, but conspirator Decius Brutus re-interprets her concerns and Caesar decides to go. Despite another warning from the Soothsayer, Caesar continues to the Senate, where he is killed. Brutus is planning to explain the act to the frightened populace when Antony arrives and asks for a chance to speak at Caesar’s funeral. Brutus agrees despite Cassius’ objections, saying that having Antony involved in this event will make it more effective. Brutus speaks to the crowd about why he killed Caesar, apparently convincing them that the assassination was justified. Antony then speaks to the crowd and aggressively turns the tables, riling them into a vengeful rage. The conspirators are run out of Rome.

#### ACT II

Caesar’s heir Octavius has returned to Rome, now allied with Antony and Lepidus. The new triumvirate plans a grand-scale killing of their political enemies including much of the Senate, and prepares to meet Brutus and Cassius on the battlefield. Brutus and Cassius have a fight over ethics and tactics that threatens their alliance and friendship, but Brutus agrees to disagree in the end. Brutus tells Cassius that Portia committed suicide after they were run out of Rome, rendering Cassius too thrown to object to Brutus’ battle plan effectively, and they decide to take their stand at Philippi. Caesar’s ghost appears to Brutus in the night. At a key point in the battle, Cassius mistakenly believes he and Brutus have lost and kills himself, as does ally Titinius after finding Cassius dead. The battle quickly turns against Brutus in earnest, and Brutus commits suicide as well. Antony and Octavius plan to honor Brutus in death.

#### CIVILIANS

Excited to make his Worlds Elsewhere debut, **Justin Bailey** (Soothsayer/Messenger/Strato; he/him) he has never been afraid to try something new just because he's never done it before. That's what makes it new, right? The majority of his previous acting has been volunteer or hobby-based, the most prominent of which being a crew member of Haunted Overload in New Hampshire, which he has done off and on for over a decade. Special thanks to Marjorie Mersereau, for helping give him the acting bug in the first place.

#### MILITARY

**Jamie McConnaughy** (Marullus/Citizen 1/Messala; she/her) is a 31-year-old cinephile, who still can't believe how lucky she is to get to work with all of her talented co-stars.

When not supporting the plot to overthrow Caesar, she can be found hosting _[<i yt>Musical Hell</i>](youtube.com/musicalhell)_ on YouTube, on the podcasts _[<i pod>Once More With Dragons</i>](https://broadwaypodcastnetwork.com/project_tag/once-more-with-dragons/)_ and _[<i pod>The Dear Friends Podcast</i>](https://broadwaypodcastnetwork.com/podcast/dear-friends/)_, and trying to be a travel agent in the middle of a pandemic. Her other claim to fame is appearing on Jeopardy in 2014 and pretending to be clever for a few days.

**Sam Marchiony** (Lucilius/Caesars’ Servants; she/her) previously appeared in Worlds Elsewhere’s productions of _A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream_ (Philostrate) and _Lysistrata_ (Ismenia).

She has about 20 different projects in various stages of development, but doesn't want to jinx the progress on any of them by talking about them in detail. So, instead, she wants to leave you with this message: _fascism delenda est_.

### Production

**Meryl Federman** (Director; she/her) is an NY-based TV/film accountant, but would be a professional Shakespeare nerd if that were a job. She is so thankful for this opportunity to be directing her favorite Shakespeare play with this amazing group, and can’t wait to embrace all the huggers on the team in person! Her screen name and Twitter handle has, for real, always been [<i twitter>@Cassius614</i>](https://twitter.com/cassius614), but she promises no favoritism of one character over another throughout this process. WETC Credits: Lysander, _A Midsummer Night’s Charity Stream; _Producer, _Lysistrata._

**Bex Silberfein** (Assistant Director; she/her) is thrilled to once again assist with a Worlds Elsewhere production.

She is forever grateful and inspired to work with such a talented group of performers. She doesn’t intentionally have a small social media footprint, but her continued hiatus from Twitter has been very restful.

**Dodger of Zion**’s (Technical Director; she/her) last technical work was for Worlds Elsewhere’s 2020 Winter Cabaret. She is also responsible for the spawning of the “Hail the Cone” meme. She streams on [<i twitch>Twitch.tv</i>](https://twitch.tv/dodgerofzion), and is the Philadelphia sports contributor to the weekly YouTube sports podcast The Dumpster Fire.
